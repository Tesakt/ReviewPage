                        Han Li, a poor and ordinary boy from a remote village, is taken in as an Unofficial Disciple by a minor sect from Jiang Hu. 
                        Despite his mediocre aptitude, Han Li is determined to establish a foothold for himself in the sect and embarks on the treacherous path of cultivation. 
                        Along the way, he faces powerful enemies and overcomes numerous challenges, but his determination and will to succeed never wavers. 
                        Can Han Li achieve immortality and make a name for himself in the world of Jiang Hu?<br><br>
                        As a casual reader, I must say that I am thoroughly enjoying this book. 
                        Han Li is a fantastic main character, and I love how he is not your typical overpowered MC. 
                        Instead, he is intelligent and knows his limits, which makes him all the more relatable. 
                        His slow and steady progression is refreshing, and I appreciate how he doesn't shy away from using rare and extinct treasures to help him along the way.<br><br>
                        One thing that stands out to me is how Han Li is not afraid to employ caution in his fights. 
                        He doesn't rush into battle without a plan, and this makes him a truly formidable opponent. 
                        Additionally, I appreciate how the novel doesn't have any glaring plot holes or deus ex-machina moments, which makes for a much more enjoyable reading experience.<br><br>
                        One of the things that stands out to me about this author is their ability to always provide satisfying conclusions to their plots. 
                        In many books, it's common for the author to leave things hanging without providing a proper resolution. 
                        This can be frustrating for readers who have invested time and emotional energy into the story and its characters.
                        However, this author always ensures that their plots are properly concluded. 
                        They don't shy away from tying up loose ends and providing satisfying endings for their characters. 
                        This attention to detail and commitment to storytelling makes for a much more enjoyable reading experience, and it's one of the reasons why I continue to be a fan of this author's work.<br><br>
                        Additionally, this ability to provide proper conclusions to their plots also adds a sense of credibility and reliability to the author's work. 
                        As a reader, I know that I can trust this author to take me on a journey and provide a satisfying conclusion at the end. 
                        This level of trust is important, and it's something that not all authors are able to achieve.<br><br>
                        Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of smart, well-written characters and high-quality fighting scenes. 
                        Han Li is a true standout, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for him in the next book.
